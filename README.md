Simple node simulation: attraction and repulsion.

The grouping of the nodes peaked my interest. For this reason, simple controls have been added to help study this phenomenon.

## Ideas to go on

1. seeding random:
      * Unfortunately, Math.random() cannot be seeded by users. Alternative algorithm needs to be adopted.
      * One such: https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom
2. physics parameters tweak (attraction, repulsion)
3. node size
4. input from file (node + edge list, or edge list only)
5. adding graph layout algorithms (or additional physics rules)
